Script would work exactly like the "Add attribute" function, but it would retain the parameters and allow for multiple
variables (separated by commas)

Consider adding:

Textfield with list of affected attributes.
Hide/unhide attributes for selected elements.
Lock/unlock attributes for selected elements.
Auto create a list of attributes for selected elements.
Auto delete a list of attributes for selected elements.
Maybe attempt to change the order of the attributes within Maya.
